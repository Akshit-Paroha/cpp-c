The Jewellery Management System project is designed to streamline operations in jewelry stores by automating inventory management, billing, and customer data handling. This system aims to reduce manual errors, enhance data accuracy, and improve the speed of customer transactions. Developed using C++, it incorporates object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling to ensure a modular, extendable design. Key objectives include providing a secure login for administrators, dynamic item management, and automated bill generation.

The methodology involves creating classes for each module: admin, jewellery, inventory, and sales, each with specific responsibilities such as handling user authentication, managing inventory, and generating bills. Data is stored persistently using file handling in C++, with details.txt for single-time data storage and inventory.txt for appended data. This ensures that item details and transaction records are secure and easily retrievable.

Key findings from the implementation and testing phase demonstrate that the system reduces manual workloads, minimizes billing errors, and provides a user-friendly interface for store employees. The project significantly enhances the efficiency of store operations, leading to faster transaction times and improved customer satisfaction. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface and multi-branch support to further extend the system's capabilities.
